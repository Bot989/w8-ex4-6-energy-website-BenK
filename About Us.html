            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>This website was created as part of a university project focused on building interactive web-based data visualizations for energy consumption patterns in Australian household appliances.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to help consumers understand the energy consumption of their household appliances and make informed purchasing decisions that reduce both costs and environmental impact.</p>
            
            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p>The data used in our visualizations comes from publicly available information provided by the Australian Government's energy rating program and manufacturer specifications.</p>
