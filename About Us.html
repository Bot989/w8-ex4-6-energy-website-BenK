            <h1>Appliance Energy Consumption in Australia</h1>
            <p>Welcome to our energy consumption information portal. Here you'll find data visualizations and information about energy usage patterns for various household appliances in the Australian market.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Energy Efficiency Matters</h2>
            <p>Energy-efficient appliances help reduce electricity bills and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding the energy consumption of your appliances can help you make informed purchasing decisions and reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
            
            <h2>Explore Our Visualizations</h2>
            <p>Navigate to specific appliance categories to see detailed energy consumption data visualizations and comparisons between different models available in Australia.</p>

            <h1>Television Energy Consumption</h1>
            <p>Modern televisions vary widely in their energy consumption depending on screen size, technology type, and features.</p>
            
            <h2>Comparing Television Technologies</h2>
            <p>LED, OLED, and QLED televisions have different energy consumption profiles. Our data shows that screen size is typically the biggest factor in determining energy usage.</p>
            
            <h2>Energy Star Ratings</h2>
            <p>Australia's Energy Star rating system helps consumers identify energy-efficient television models. Higher star ratings indicate lower energy consumption and operating costs.</p>
